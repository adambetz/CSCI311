IMPORTANT NOTE: 

To have the navigation work correctly, you MUST use the smaller screen in the 115 lab, 
or the 112 lab room. If you are viewing this from home, the size of webpage cannot be larger than 17 
inches from corner to corner, otherwise the navigation to each of the rooms will be off. 

There are Opaque coloured boxes over the navigation boxes to help ensure you know where each room is.

Brief Description:

This webpage is a game designed to emulate the everyday life of a CSCI student. They have the ability to
travel between the Gym, Classrooms, Pub, Residence and the Computer Lab.

While in each of these rooms, you will have a different set of actions available to you.
